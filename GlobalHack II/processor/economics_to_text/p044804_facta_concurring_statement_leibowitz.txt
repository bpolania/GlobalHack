Concurring Statement of 

Commissioner Jon Leibowitz

Study of Insurance Scores Pursuant to Section 215 of the 
Fair and Accurate Transactions Act of 2003 (“FACTA”)

FTC Project No. P044804

I voted to release this Report because staff’s analysis of the data – albeit data primarily provided
by a subset of insurers that elected to submit their data for the study – makes a substantial
contribution to public discussion in this area.  While the analysis demonstrates that credit-based
insurance scores are correlated with risk, countering the hypothesis that scores are used
principally as a proxy for race or ethnicity, the results in today’s Report are of course no cause
for celebration.  The differences in credit-based insurance scores across racial and ethnic groups
are a disturbing reminder that our society is – still – not race blind, and that vestiges of our
history of discrimination remain ever-present.

We can, and must, do more.
