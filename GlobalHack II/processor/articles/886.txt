Former South African president Nelson Mandela continued to make steady improvement in hospital, the presidency said Wednesday.

Doctors are happy with Mandela's progress, presidential spokesman Mac Maharaj said.

"His doctors say he continues to respond satisfactorily to treatment and is much better now than he was when he was admitted to hospital March 27, 2013," Xinhua quoted Maharaj as saying.

"He has been visited by family and continues to make steady progress."

Mandela, 94, was re-admitted due to the recurrence of his lung infection. On March 9, Mandela was sent to a hospital in Pretoria for a scheduled medical check-up to manage existing conditions in line with his age.

Mandela served as South African president from 1994 to 1999. He had spent 27 years in prison before elected the first black president in the country after the end of apartheid.

His lung problem was the result of tuberculosis developed when he was in prison.

Mandela's failing health has been the focus of attention in the past recent years.

On Dec 8, he was taken to a Pretoria hospital for a lung infection and gallstones. He stayed in the hospital for 18 days. This was Mandela's longest hospital stay since 2001 when he underwent seven weeks of radiotherapy after being diagnosed with prostate cancer.
